# Text to Scannable Code
Convert any text to scannable codes without 3rd party redirect.
Using Zxing library to code and decode.
Compilled using maven.

# How to use
1. Run App.java
2. Fill up value to encode
3. Select encode type
4. Customise color
5. Generate the code
6. Download with download button

*You can insert and resize logo into qr code. The programme will scan the qr code to see if it is still scannable after the addition of logo*

## Notes
1. First time making GUI, java, VScode, javafx, maven... Basically first time for the whole thing. This project is basically meant to learn java.
2. Decoding of codes is not good with Zxing library. Small issues can make it unreadable:
- A bit far
- Slightly tilted
- Not flat
3. Planned to use OpenCV to fix the scanning issue but tried forever to import OpenCV into maven. Nothing works...
4. I want to go back to python

## Future Plans (Very far in future. Need catch up in school work)
1. Shortcut to generate unique codes for wifi passowords etc.
2. Make an executable
3. Get OpenCV to work
4. Add a way to use camera to scanning
5. Maybe try making an android app
6. Make a python version (i miss pip install)
